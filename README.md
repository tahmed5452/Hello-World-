# Hello-World-
My first true repository, consisting of the good ol' "Hello World!".
I am student from Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School in Hamilton Ontario. I'm 17 years old. I enjoy computers, and programming. I also like to read, play video games, and watch various media such as films, TV shows and more. I hope to one day do something good that benefits everybody in the world.
